# Azure Architecture Icons

Latest version(s) hosted on: https://thijstijsma.github.io/azure-architecture-icons/

Index of Azure Architecture Icons in SVG format.

Clicking an image writes 2 blobs to your clipboard:
- URI to SVG image
- SVG image rendered as a 128x128px PNG to work around the Clipboard API not supporting "image/svg+xml"

Depending on the application you're using this will result in text (the URI to the SVG image) or an image.
